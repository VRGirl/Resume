        <h3>Innovation Fellow   2013-current</h3>
        <p>I serve several roles in an agile-style IT/Marketing environment as Project Manager, Business Analyst, Product Owner, and UX Designer. I handle multiple projects at a time, learning new software and management skills as required. I have delivered projects on-time and at (or under) budget from constructing an Ebook using iBooks author as project manager, product owner, and data visualization team member, to building an out-ward facing undergraduate magazine for Georgia State University Honors College where I served as project lead, content writer, product owner, UX designer, and client consultant.</p>

        <h3>Senior Contributing Editor of <i>Hybrid Pedagogy</i> 2012 - current</h3>
        <p>For 4 years, I have been editing for the all online, open access, peer reviewed pedagogy journal, <a href="http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/" title="hybrid pedagogy home page"><i>Hybrid Pedagogy</i></a>. Using primarily Google Documents, hangouts, and slack, I work to provide the journal with the best possible content. I work with successful authors in at a speed faster than typical academic publishing. My authors are happy with the co-editing, peer-review process. I have authored several articles published in the journal, and lead authors by this example.  </p>
        <!-- I'm going to need to decide how to spice these up. I have websites on websites featuring my materials. Not sure if I should point to them or not -->
        <h3>Composition Instructor 2006 - 2014</h3>
        <p>As both a graduate instructor, and a full-time lecturer, I successfully taught several courses per semester for 20-25 students per course for 8+ years. I built my own courses according to expected learning outcomes and assessment models. I constructed lesson plans and exacted them each class with measured success. Further, I mentored many new instructors, leading workshops, and giving one-on-one instruction. I was awarded teacher of the year in 2010 and teacher and mentor of the year in 2013.

        <h3>Conference Organizer and Chair 2006 - 2014</h3>
        <p>For 6 consecutive years, I chaired, or faculty sponsored the graduate English conference at both <a href="http://peaksconference.weebly.com/nau--flagstaff.html" title="Peaks Home Page">Northern Arizona University</a>, <a href="http://sites.gsu.edu/new-voices/" title="New Voices Home Page">Georgia State University</a>, and <a href="http://thatcamp.org/" title="THATCamp Web Page">nationally</a>. As chair, I delegated necessary tasks, made final decisions, and kept all committee members on task. My first year as chair at both universities, I had to reconstruct the committee and tasks, as well as build a storage place and create a system of reproduction. Both university conferences are still running as I set them up.</p>
